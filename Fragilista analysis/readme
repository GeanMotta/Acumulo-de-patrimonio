In this directory multiple small programs will be added with the objective of measuring the extent to which commonly accepted analysis tools show defensible results in real situations. Is standart deviation really useful for measuring risk? Is CAPM useful for a real portfolio? Why to apply tools for market analysis that seem scientific, but end up not showing good results?

Portfolio managers should not play with people's lifetime savings. Purely numerical retroactive analysis based on statistics may look "scientific", but downplays the influence of unforeseeable events (e.g. coronavirus). The biggest risk is the one we cannot predict, so we may need to look elsewhere to find a good way to diversify our investments.

The following modules are already complete:

>Bogus_Standart_Deviation: Any person that has ever invested in T-bonds will be able to tell you that the standart deviation for the "risk free" asset is pretty far from being a 0. Anyone exploring new public companies (mostly in the tech world) will show you how unpredictable stocks can be. Standart deviation is pretty useful in a lot of things, but using it as a measure of RISK is foolish.
    In this small module, use the variable "stock" to set the ticker of the company that will be used in the study. The program will gather data from 2010-2018 and calculate the standart deviation (std) of the adjusted close prices. Based on this std it will make an upper bound and lower bound from the sum and subtraction of the std value and the first closing price of 2019 (the date of the theoric investment). The program will then plot the prices for 2019 and the boundaries given by the std of the stock, and we will be able to see graphically for how much time the stock price kept inside such boundaries. The variable text_confidence is a string that will show the percentage of times (daily) that the stock price stayed inside the interval that 1 standart deviation suggested it would.
